            <p>'The Witness' has become a cult classic, which was also well received by critics and general audiences
                alike when it was finally released outside of Hungary. Its candid and realistic portrayal of the
                incompetent communist regime has earned great acclaim for both the director and the film itself when it
                was shown at Cannes Film Festival in 1981. 'The Witness' takes place during the height of the Rákosi
                Era, which was closely modeled after the ruthless and brutal Stalin regime. The film follows the life of
                an ordinary dike keeper, József Pelikán, who has been caught for illegally slaughtering his pig, Dezsõ.
                Instead of doing hard time for his "heinous" crime, Pelikán is elevated into an important position,
                generally reserved for the communist elite. Of course, Pelikán is utterly clueless about his newfound
                luck, not to mention his new job. E</p>
